# Deploy an API to Choreo Connect

You can use either one of the following methods to add APIs to Choreo Connect.

- [**Via WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M)**]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/deploy-api/deploy-api-via-apim)

    By enabling the Control Plane Event Hub in the Choreo Connect configuration file, the APIs deployed in WSO2 API Manager will automatically be available in Choreo Connect. 

- [**Via the CLI tool (apictl)**]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/deploy-api/deploy-api-via-apictl)

    If you have not started using WSO2 API Manager yet, or you want to try out Choreo Connect as a Standalone Gateway, simply use the CLI tool [apictl](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim-tooling/releases) to host your APIs.
